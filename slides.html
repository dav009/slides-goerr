# Go for a month

# So I started coding in go not so long ago
--

- specifically around ~1 month ago

--

- I've been doing `scala` + `python` for quite a while

--

- here are the stuff I found a bit strange/different/like and disliked

--

- Sorry, I'm still not a "fan", but I'm having fun learning something new

--

- Sorry for the horrible slides

---

# ðŸ¤” Lets try a toy project

--

# just you know.. to get started

---

## I contribute to some open source projects that use wikipedia

--



## let's try playing a bit with that

--

- Gonna download the wikipedia dump

--

- and play with regexes in golang

--

- Don't ask why, but I decided to create a big regex ðŸ™ˆ

--

- A big regex like: `[word1 | word2 | word3...word100.000]`


---

---

![](images/ss2.png)

---

## for some reason I was expecting that to be super fast..

--

### anyway, ended up learning a bunch about:
 - `runes` and `strings`

--

### at the end of the day speeded up a lot by using tries:

https://github.com/dav009/flash

--

well that was just for fun, nothing really interesting...

---

## From there I faced other challenges

###  Error handling


### Dependencies

---

# Dependencies

--
in python tooling is quite mature


--

- my recommendation: use `https://github.com/golang/dep`

--

- checks your code, and import dependencies in it

--

- dependencies are dumped to the `vendors` folder

--

- you don't have to touch it

--

- versioning is expected to be done via github tags

--

---

# Error Handling

--
 
# ðŸ˜¢

--

# ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜¢

--

---

# it is hard to explain, I will do my best

---

# I like `if err!=nil`

--

- I see many people complaining about this

--

- I like it, I prefer `errors` over `exceptions`

--

- coming from monadic error handling I dislike the pumping tho

--


- but I can live with it :)

--

## so what do I really find challenging?


---

## I went to my dummy app, and tried to create an http layer

--

## so far Ive been handling errors by retuning them. my app is a terminal bin:

--
```golang
something, err = f(a, b)
if err!=nil{
  return nil, err
}
...
```

--

- mmm where are the stacktraces?

--
- ðŸ˜ž there are no stacktraces


--

- googles a bit: finds `pkg/errors`
- ah this makes sense, I can wrap my errors:

```go
something, err = f(a, b)
if err=nil{
  return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "somthing bad happened when X")
}

```
---

# it works well for my terminal bin, I want to see all the stackstrace..

--
## gonna handle errors in my http layer.

--

## should be easy right? ðŸ¤”

--
## in my http layer, I want to get:
- `errorA` as a `403`
- `errorB` as a `404`


---

- errors are strings, how do I match them?. ah `errors/pkg` has `Cause()`

--

- for `errors/pkg` errors look a bit like:

--

- `['str,'st', 'str', 'str'.... actualError ]`

--
- `Cause` gives you the first error from that stack

--

so in your top layer:

- you just have to call `Cause()`

--

- and check that matches your error? ðŸ¤” maybe..

--

- but then you get really low level erros on your top layer..
--

- it seems clumsy to match them as strings....


## GOES TO GOOGLEE.....


---

## aha, Dave Cheney has some notes on this:

- https://dave.cheney.net/2016/06/12/stack-traces-and-the-errors-package

- https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully

--

- now I am really confused, I was doing exactly what dave cheney advocates not to do. `sentinel errors`..

--

```golang
package A
var ErrorA = errors.New("my favourite error! ahggg") // sentinel err
...
...
...

package b
if err == ErrorA {

..
}
```

--

## I am confused ðŸ˜‘

---

So there are a few things I want to do (that maybe people dont want to do)

--

- I want to have stackstraces (or maybe not?)

--

- I want to be able to match errors in a sensible way.

--

- I want to divide my application in layers, each layer has its domain

--
- errors propagated upwards are only the ones defined within the lower layer

--

- example: http layer, I want to display informative error messages without revealing sensible information

--

- I want to log the error with sensible information

--

## lets go to github
## lets ask on golang slack channel

---
## Slack answers


- https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining

- it has its own glue to achieve some (not all of the things I mentioned)
 


---
## Github: Aha terraform (hashicorp) has many projects in golang

--
found two interesting libraries

--

- github.com/hashicorp/errwrap

- https://github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror

--

- Hashicorp projects has many of the things I want 

--

- Looked at other projects, everybody has some flavored implementation of `errors/pkg`

- so many disparate approaches..

---

## errwrap

- it is like `pkg/errors`

--

- it does not provide stackstraces

--

- it lets you stack errors, but they are stored as actual errors, not as just strings.

--

- it lets you match errors in different ways

--

- you can match an error in the stack of errors

--

---

## go-multierror

- it lets you carry a list of errors

--

- it has the semantics that a call can generate multiple errors

--

---

## Also found https://github.com/go-errors/errors


- which hashicorp seems to use along `errwrapper`

--

- it has same interface as `errors` (std library)

--

- but it has stackstraces

---

## What I saw inside of some projects looks a bit like

--

```golang
package internalLayer

errA := Error("A")
errB := Error("B")
errC := Error("C")

```

--

```golang
package upperLayer

func z() {

 a, err := internalservice.F()

  switch err{

    case errA ... do something
    case errB ... do something
    ..
 }
}
```

---

## Some suggested me that a more gopher way would be to be :

--

## defensive..

--
as in:

```
func z(){

err := internalService.checkPossibleErrA()

if err!=nil { .... } // handle A

err : = internalService.checkForPossibleErrB()

if err!=nil {...} //handle B
 a, err := internalService.F()
}

```

---

# Sorry I ran out of time preparing my material

- my point is, `err` handling is really painful

--

- there are lots of tools out there

--

- each project does it verrry differently

--

- probably I am taking the wrong approach

--

- would love to get some feedback

--
